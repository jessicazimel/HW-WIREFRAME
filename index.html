      <p>Jessica Zimel is a former pastry chef, who finally decided to pursue what she was always meant to do: computers. </p>
      
      <p>From a young age, she always liked to tinker around with the family computer, and play with legos instead of dolls, so it has always been programmed into her blood. As time went on, she tapped into her everflowing interest, and taste for cuisine, and decided to pursue Pastry Arts. As much as she enjoyed her days of decorating and creating beautiful pieces, the toll of waking up every early morning started to dampen the love of the craft.
